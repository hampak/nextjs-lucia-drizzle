# NextJS + Lucia + Drizzle

This is a starter for those who want to integrate NextJS, Lucia, and Drizzle ORM for their projects. I have a blog post on this [here]().

There are more features to be added such as...
- shortening the session's lifetime
- adding toast notifications
- adding a logout button

You can progressively add new features (such as the ones above).

## Steps

- download and run `npm i`
- create `.env` file
- add the `DATABASE_URL` value in your `.env` file
- run `npm run dev`
- try creating new user
